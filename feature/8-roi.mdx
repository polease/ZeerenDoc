### 8  ROI & Governance Dashboard — Detailed Requirements

| ID | Feature | Functional Requirements |
|----|---------|-------------------------|
| **8.1** | **Cost Tracking** | 8.1.1 Collect granular cost events for LLM tokens, tool invocations, agent runtime, human labor hours, and material purchases. <br />8.1.2 Aggregate costs at task, Work, Domain, and tenant levels with drill-down and time-range filters. <br />8.1.3 Provide CSV/JSON export and webhook push of daily cost summaries. <br />8.1.4 Support cost tagging (e.g., “R&D”, “client billable”, “internal”) for allocation reporting. |
| **8.2** | **Value Capture Metrics** | 8.2.1 Allow admins to define custom value KPIs (e.g., revenue generated, tickets closed, SLA compliance) and formulas per Work Domain. <br />8.2.2 Capture deliverable counts automatically (apps shipped, reports approved) and map them to KPIs. <br />8.2.3 Display real-time value counters and cumulative graphs alongside cost data. <br />8.2.4 Provide manual value entry UI for qualitative outcomes that cannot be auto-captured. |
| **8.3** | **ROI Analytics & Threshold Alerts** | 8.3.1 Calculate ROI per Work and in aggregate: `ROI = (Value – Cost) / Cost` with live updates. <br />8.3.2 Set alert rules (absolute cost ceiling, negative ROI duration, cost-to-value ratio) that trigger e-mail, Slack, or webhook notifications. <br />8.3.3 Offer heat-map view highlighting Works whose ROI falls below thresholds. <br />8.3.4 Supply comparison widgets (this month vs. last month, Domain A vs. Domain B). |
| **8.4** | **Risk Management Rules** | 8.4.1 Define risk policies (budget overrun %, SLA breach count, critical incident severity). <br />8.4.2 Automatically flag high-risk Works and require human approval to continue. <br />8.4.3 Maintain rule library with version history; enable/disable rules per tenant plan. <br />8.4.4 Provide audit trail of all rule evaluations and resulting actions (pause, escalate, notify). |
| **8.5** | **Audit Logs & Traceability** | 8.5.1 Store immutable records of cost/value adjustments, rule configuration changes, and ROI overrides. <br />8.5.2 Offer faceted search by actor, action type, Work ID, and date range. <br />8.5.3 Allow download of signed CSV/JSON bundles for compliance submissions. <br />8.5.4 Integrate with external SIEM: stream log events via HTTPS or S3 sink. |
