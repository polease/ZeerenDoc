### 7  Tool Registry & Execution — Detailed Requirements  

| ID | Feature | Functional Requirements |
|----|---------|-------------------------|
| **7.1** | **Tool Types & MCP-Based Runtime** | 7.1.1 **Tool Categories**:  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;• *Foundation & Execution Tools* – search, file I/O, browser automation, shell / CLI. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;• *Business-Domain Tools* – CRM, payment, 3-D asset, code generation, analytics, etc. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;• *Enterprise-Internal Connectors* – OA, CMS, ticketing, ERP, custom micro-services. <br />7.1.2 All tools are registered through a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** manifest (name, version, capabilities, JSON-Schema I/O, auth method). <br />7.1.3 The runtime dynamically loads MCP manifests, validates schema, and hot-mounts the tool without engine restart. <br />7.1.4 Adapters are provided to wrap legacy HTTP / gRPC or local CLI utilities into MCP-compliant tools. <br />7.1.5 Built-in executors support both synchronous and streaming modes and create a per-task sandboxed file system; a diagnostic endpoint echoes the exact command or API invoked for full auditability. |
| **7.2** | **Global Permission & Rate Control** | 7.2.1 Each invocation is checked against tenant plan limits, role/worker allowances, and tool-specific quotas. <br />7.5.2 The engine enforces per-tool concurrency caps and burst ceilings; excess requests enter a FIFO queue. <br />7.5.3 Every call is logged with caller identity, input hash, execution time, cost metrics, and result size. <br />7.5.4 Admin API endpoints allow privileged operators to reset or temporarily override quotas during incidents or emergency operations. |
