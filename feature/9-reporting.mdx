### 9  Analytics & Reporting — Detailed Requirements

| ID | Feature | Functional Requirements |
|----|---------|-------------------------|
| **9.1** | **Work Progress Dashboards** | 9.1.1 Provide real-time charts for task status counts (to-do, in-progress, blocked, done) across all Works or filtered by Domain, project, assignee, or label. <br />9.1.2 Show burndown/burn-up graphs and critical-path Gantt slices with auto-refresh. <br />9.1.3 Offer widget builder so users can pin custom KPIs (lead time, cycle time, agent vs. human ratio). <br />9.1.4 Allow export of any chart as PNG/SVG and underlying data as CSV/JSON. |
| **9.2** | **Resource Usage Analytics** | 9.2.1 Track storage growth, file count, and external provider bandwidth per Work and tenant. <br />9.2.2 Display heat-maps for “hot” resources (most accessed, largest, fastest-growing). <br />9.2.3 Correlate resource usage spikes with task events and tool calls for root-cause insights. <br />9.2.4 Provide cleanup recommendations (unused versions, orphan files) with one-click purge preview. |
| **9.3** | **Agent Performance Insights** | 9.3.1 Capture metrics per Agent Worker: average tokens, tool call success rate, retry count, latency, confidence score, user feedback (thumbs-up/down). <br />9.3.2 Rank agents by efficiency (value generated per cost) and reliability (failure rate). <br />9.3.3 Drill into individual runs with full reasoning trace and time-line of tool invocations. <br />9.3.4 Suggest model or prompt tuning when KPIs fall below configurable thresholds. |
| **9.4** | **Custom Report Builder** | 9.4.1 Drag-and-drop interface to assemble tables, charts, and markdown commentary from any dataset exposed by the analytics API. <br />9.4.2 Support scheduled report e-mails (PDF/HTML) and public share links with token-based access. <br />9.4.3 Allow SQL-like query editor for power users; auto-generate visualizations based on result schema. <br />9.4.4 Store report templates with version history and permission controls (private, team, tenant-wide). |
