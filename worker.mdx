# 👷 EAP - Worker & Agent Architecture

In the EAP (Enterprise Agent Platform), **Workers** are the core executors of tasks.  
They can be either **Human Workers** or **Agent Workers**, working collaboratively within a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).

---

## 🧑‍💼 What is a Worker?

A **Worker** is an assigned executor of a task node in the WBS. Each Worker may represent:

- A **Human**, such as a real developer or product manager
- An **Agent**, powered by large language models (LLMs), with autonomous reasoning and tool usage capabilities

---

## 👥 Worker Types

### 1. 🤖 Agent Worker

Represents an AI agent, abstracted by role and skill, backed by a specific LLM.

#### ✅ Attributes:
- `name`: e.g., `Senior Developer Agent`
- `title`: e.g., `LLM Code Engineer`
- `llm_provider`: e.g., `OpenAI GPT-4`, `DeepSeek-V2`, `Claude`, etc.
- `work_skills`: list of skills (e.g., `frontend coding`, `API integration`, `unit testing`)
- `agent_type`: `AgentWorker`

### 2. 🧑 Human Worker

Represents a real human contributor, who performs tasks manually or through a user interface.

#### ✅ Attributes:
- `name`: e.g., `Alice Zhang`
- `title`: e.g., `Senior Frontend Developer`
- `role`: e.g., `Tester`, `Project Manager`, `Junior Developer`
- `worker_type`: `HumanWorker`

---

## 🏗️ Example Worker Roles

Workers in a domain (e.g., Coding) may include:

- `Project Manager`
- `Developer`
  - `Junior Developer`
  - `Senior Developer`
- `Tester`
  - `Junior Tester`
  - `Senior Tester`

Each of the above roles can be implemented as either **Human** or **Agent Worker** depending on the context or availability.

---

## ⚙️ Workerization

In a **Workerization** context, a team (virtual or hybrid) includes multiple Workers of different types and roles, dynamically composed to execute a specific Work instance.

```plaintext
Workerization: "Build a Web App"
├── 👨‍💼 Project Manager (Human)
├── 🤖 Senior Developer (Agent)
├── 👩‍💻 Junior Developer (Human)
└── 🤖 Tester Agent (Agent)
🧠 From Agent Worker → Action Agent
An Agent Worker is an abstract role. During actual execution, it is instantiated as an Action Agent.

📌 What is an Action Agent?
An Action Agent is a concrete instance that includes:


Attribute	Description
system_message	Prompt instructions and role settings
llm_backend	Underlying LLM engine (e.g., gpt-4o, deepseek-coder, etc.)
input_schema	Expected input format / fields
output_schema	Response structure / contract
tools_allowed	List of tools this agent can call (e.g., browser, API, code runner)
